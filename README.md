# JD Parts - E-Commerce Site for Computer Parts

## Overview
This is a responsive e-commerce website designed for selling computer parts such as GPUs, CPUs, and RAMs. The site features a sleek, techno-inspired aesthetic with a modern layout. It is built as a static (non-scrollable) page that adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices. The brand name incorporates "JD" as specified, and the site includes a collapsible menu on mobile views.

This project was developed using basic web technologies for a simple, front-end-only experience. It's ideal for demonstration or as a starting point for a more advanced e-commerce application.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The site automatically adjusts for PC and mobile interfaces. On mobile, a collapsible menu appears in the upper-right corner, with options sliding in from the right.
- **Sleek Techno Feel**: Utilizes a dark gradient background, neon accents, and a futuristic font to create a high-tech vibe.
- **Static (Non-Scrollable) Layout**: Content is designed to fit within the viewport on both PC and mobile, preventing vertical scrolling.
- **Product Display**: Features a grid of products (e.g., GPU, CPU, RAM) with basic details and "Add to Cart" buttons.
- **Navigation**: Horizontal menu on desktop; hamburger menu on mobile for easy access to pages like Home, Products, About, and Contact.
- **Footer**: Includes the required text: "Developed by: JOHN DAVE A. BARILEA | Created 2025 | All rights reserved."

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, responsiveness, and animations (e.g., media queries for mobile adaptation and transitions for the menu).
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements, such as toggling the mobile menu.
- **External Resources**: Google Fonts (e.g., Orbitron for a techno font).

## Installation
This project is a static website, so no server or complex setup is required. Follow these steps to get it running:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - If this is part of a Git repository, clone it using:
     ```
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Otherwise, download the project files (e.g., `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and this `README.md`) and place them in a new folder on your local machine.

2. **Prerequisites**:
   - A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
   - Ensure you have an internet connection for loading external fonts (via Google Fonts).

3. **Run the Site**:
   - Open `index.html` directly in your web browser by double-clicking the file or using a command like:
     ```
     open index.html  (on macOS)
     ```
     or
     ```
     start index.html  (on Windows)
     ```
   - The site will load locally in your browser.

## Usage
- **Viewing on Desktop**: The site displays a full layout with a horizontal navigation menu at the top. Browse the featured products and interact with the buttons.
- **Viewing on Mobile**: Resize your browser window to simulate a mobile device (under 768px width). Click the hamburger icon (â˜°) in the upper-right corner to open the menu, which slides in from the right.
- **Interacting with the Site**: 
  - Click navigation links to navigate (though this is a static site, links are placeholders).
  - Hover over product cards for a subtle zoom effect.
  - Note: "Add to Cart" buttons are non-functional in this version; they would require backend integration for a full e-commerce experience.

## Screenshots
(You can add actual screenshots here. For now, here's a description:)
- **Desktop View**: Shows the full header, product grid, and footer.
